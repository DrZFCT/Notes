abstract = {This book provides an introduction to Lie groups, Lie algebras, and repre­ sentation theory, aimed at graduate students in mathematics and physics. Although there are already several excellent books that cover many of the same topics, this book has two distinctive features that I hope will make it a useful addition to the literature. First, it treats Lie groups (not just Lie alge­ bras) in a way that minimizes the amount of manifold theory needed. Thus, I neither assume a prior course on differentiable manifolds nor provide a con­ densed such course in the beginning chapters. Second, this book provides a gentle introduction to the machinery of semi simple groups and Lie algebras by treating the representation theory of SU(2) and SU(3) in detail before going to the general case. This allows the reader to see roots, weights, and the Weyl group "in action" in simple cases before confronting the general theory. The standard books on Lie theory begin immediately with the general case: a smooth manifold that is also a group. The Lie algebra is then defined as the space of left-invariant vector fields and the exponential mapping is defined in terms of the flow along such vector fields. This approach is undoubtedly the right one in the long run, but it is rather abstract for a reader encountering such things for the first time.},

@book{RomanSteven2013Ala,
abstract = {This book is a thorough introduction to linear algebra, for the graduate or advanced undergraduate student. Prerequisites are limited to a knowledge of the basic properties of matrices and determinants. However, since we cover the basics of vector spaces and linear transformations rather rapidly, a prior course in linear algebra (even at the sophomore level), along with a certain measure of "mathematical maturity," is highly desirable. Chapter 0 contains a summary of certain topics in modern algebra that are required for the sequel. This chapter should be skimmed quickly and then used primarily as a reference. Chapters 1-3 contain a discussion of the basic properties of vector spaces and linear transformations. Chapter 4 is devoted to a discussion of modules, emphasizing a comparison between the properties of modules and those of vector spaces. Chapter 5 provides more on modules. The main goals of this chapter are to prove that any two bases of a free module have the same cardinality and to introduce noetherian modules. However, the instructor may simply skim over this chapter, omitting all proofs. Chapter 6 is devoted to the theory of modules over a principal ideal domain, establishing the cyclic decomposition theorem for finitely generated modules. This theorem is the key to the structure theorems for finite dimensional linear operators, discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. Chapter 9 is devoted to real and complex inner product spaces.},
