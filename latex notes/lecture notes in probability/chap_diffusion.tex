\chapter{Markov Semigroup Theory}

The core idea of Markov semigroup theory is to encode the behavior of a Markov process $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ via operators which act on functions.
We can then develop calculus rules for working with these operators, and study them using tools from functional analysis.
This is analogous to how the linear algebraic study of the transition matrix of a discrete-time Markov chain reveals properties (e.g., ergodicity, convergence) of the chain.
