abstract = {"This is the second edition of the now definitive text on partial differential equations (PDE). It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical study of PDE with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in PDE. For this edition, the author has made numerous changes, including: a new chapter on nonlinear wave equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, and a significantly expanded bibliography."--Publisher's description.},

abstract = {This book is an introductory text in functional analysis. Unlike many modern treatments, it begins with the particular and works its way to the more general.
From the reviews: "This book is an excellent text for a first graduate course in functional analysis...Many interesting and important applications are included...It includes an abundance of exercises, and is written in the engaging and lucid style which we have come to expect from the author." --MATHEMATICAL REVIEWS},
